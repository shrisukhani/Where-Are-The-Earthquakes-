# Where Are The Earthquakes?

* I developed this project as part of [UCSD's Data Structures and Beyond Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented).

* It's an interactive map developed as a PApplet in Java using the [UnfoldingMaps API](http://unfoldingmaps.org/) and the [Processing API](https://www.processing.org/). You must have the both of these installed in your IDE to be able to run this program. You also need to be connected to the internet.

* The map displays Earthquake Information, current as of the last hour and the major cities of the world.

* Click around and play with the PApplet to see what happens!

* The earthquake data is fetched and parsed by porgrams written by the UCSD course staff. The rest of the functionality was implemented by me.
